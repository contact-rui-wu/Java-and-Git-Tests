# Java-and-Git-Tests
Test project for Java basics and everything Git-related

(This readme file was added to practice resolving local vs remote conflicts)

(Not actual conflict, but two simultaneous commits)

Update:
- This time readme got fetched, I still don't know what happened
- If you did something utilizing Eclipse functions, like using the merge tool, Eclipse generates commit message for you from template
- Resolving conflict within the same file is a bitch, let's not do that in the future
- Now that readme is already on the index, let's try a simple pull and call it a day

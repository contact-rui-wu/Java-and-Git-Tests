/**
 * 1. create local project with Eclipse - done
 * 2. create local repository with EGit - done
 *   - needed to manually commit to make the NO-HEAD tag go away
 *   - needed to commit all files, else cannot save anymore
 *   - where's that commit button? why do I need to write commit message every time?
 * 3. get it on GitHub - done
 *   - but every local commit is retained, there's no "push message"
 *   - so use local commit wisely
 * 4. make some changes at local and push to remote (GitHub)
 *   - add a file and remember to also add to index
 *   - try commit and push this time
 * 5. make some changes on both sides and resolve conflict at local
 *   - ok README.md will not be fetched, probably because it's not on the index
 *   - let's edit a file (this file) which is already on the index
